# EU-FarmBook API Case Studies:
### Integrating projects and platforms via the EU-FarmBook Public API

Welcome to the repository demonstrating how projects have used the EU-FarmBook platformâ€™s 
public API (Application Programming Interface) to upload their Knowledge Objects (KOs) and metadata.

## Background

Prior to the pre-launch event of the EU-FarmBook platform in February 2024, several Horizon 2020, Horizon Europe and Operational Groups began working with the EU-FarmBook to integrate their Knowledge Objects via the API. These projects all had different use cases for the EU-FarmBook platform, and approached collecting and providing the metadata in a way which best suited their requirements. 


These projects kindly agreed to work with the EU-FarmBook to build case studies based on their approach, with a view to making these public, along with the code used to integrate their Knowledge Objects into the EU-FarmBook platform via the API.  


Some of these case studies are still ongoing, and we will thus continually update this repository to include them. 

## Case Studies

For more information on each case study, please view the separate README files in the respective project folders.

If you would like to see an example of each project's approach to collecting metadata, we have provided an example file in the folder
`metadata_processing/example_metadata` in each project folder.
